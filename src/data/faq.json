		"question": "Why wouldn't I just hire a full-time designer?",
		"answer": "The annual cost of a full-time, senior-level designer can easily exceed $100,000 (plus benefits). Not to mention the time spent creating job postings, screening applicants, and conducting interviews. You might also find yourself without enough work to keep your designers busy for 40+ hours each week, so you're paying for time that's not utilized for work."
	},
	{
		"question": "Is there a limit to how many requests I can have at one time?",
		"answer": "Nope. Once you're subscribed, you'll be able to queue up as many design requests as you'd like. However, those requests will be fulfilled one-by-one."
	},
	{
		"question": "Who are the designers?",
		"answer": "You'll be working directly with me, Alex, the founder of Cedalion Digital. I'll be your point-of-contact as well as your designer and developer. Additional services, such as custom illustrations or copywriting, will be provided by third-party contractors."
	},
	{
		"question": "How quickly will I receive my designs?",
		"answer": "Most projects will be delivered within 48 to 72 hours. Large projects (such as a full website redesign) will be broken down into smaller chunks that can be turned around in no more than 72 hours."
	},
	{
		"question": "How does it work?",
		"answer": "After you're enrolled, you'll be assigned to a custom Trello board, which you can use to queue up your design projects and choose which one you'd like to begin with. You'll also use this board to give feedback and request additional designs. You will be automatically billed in intervals according to which pricing model you selected."
	},
	{
		"question": "What if I only have a single request?",
		"answer": "No problem. Subscribe to the Monthly Plan, pause when you're finished, and return when you have additional design projects."
